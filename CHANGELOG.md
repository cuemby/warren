## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-13

### Changed - Major Refactor & Infrastructure Updates

This patch release includes a comprehensive terminology refactor and build system updates to improve code clarity and ensure consistent Go version usage across all platforms.

#### Container Terminology Refactor

Warren has completed a comprehensive refactor replacing "Task" with "Container" throughout the codebase for improved clarity and Docker/Kubernetes alignment.

**Why this change?**
- **Industry alignment**: "Container" is the standard term in Docker, Kubernetes, and container orchestration
- **User clarity**: Users think in terms of "containers", not "tasks"
- **Migration path**: Makes Warren more intuitive for users coming from Docker Swarm or Kubernetes

**What changed:**
- **Core types**: `Task` → `Container`, `TaskState` → `ContainerState`, `TaskStatus` → `ContainerStatus`
- **API methods**: `ListTasks` → `ListContainers`, `UpdateTaskStatus` → `UpdateContainerStatus`, etc.
- **Storage layer**: BoltDB bucket renamed `tasks` → `containers`
- **CLI commands**: All references updated for consistency
- **Documentation**: Updated to use "container" terminology throughout

**Impact**:
- 26 files modified, ~2,400 lines changed
- All core packages updated: types, storage, manager, worker, scheduler, reconciler, API, client
- All tests updated: unit, integration, E2E
- **Migration tool included**: `warren-migrate` command to upgrade existing databases

**Backward compatibility**:
- v1.1.0 databases automatically migrate on first v1.1.1 startup
- Migration is non-destructive with automatic backup
- See `cmd/warren-migrate/` for manual migration tool

#### Go 1.24 Upgrade

**Build system updates:**
- Updated `go.mod` to require Go 1.24.0 minimum
- Updated Dockerfile to use `golang:1.24-alpine` base image
- Updated all CI workflows (.github/workflows/*.yml) to Go 1.24
- Test matrix now validates Go 1.24 and 1.25 compatibility

**Why Go 1.24?**
- Access to latest language features and standard library improvements
- Security updates and performance optimizations
- Ensures consistent build environment across development and CI/CD

### Fixed

- **Linter compliance**: Fixed errcheck warning in migration tool
- **Docker release**: Resolved Go version mismatch preventing Docker image builds
- **Test framework documentation**: Updated examples to use Go 1.24

### Internal

- Complete refactor across 26 files in 17 commits
- Database migration tool with comprehensive backup/restore
- All tests updated and passing
- CI/CD validated with new Go version

## Release Notes

### Warren v1.1.0 Highlights

**Built-in Ingress Controller**: Warren now includes a complete ingress controller with:
- ✅ HTTP/HTTPS routing (no nginx or traefik needed!)
- ✅ Automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
- ✅ Advanced routing (rate limiting, access control, headers, path rewriting)
- ✅ Load balancing with health checks
- ✅ Production-ready with 10,000 req/s throughput
- ✅ Still single binary, still <100MB, still zero dependencies

**Use Case**: Deploy a complete web application with automatic HTTPS in 3 commands:
```bash
warren service create my-app --image nginx:latest --replicas 3 --port 80
warren ingress create my-ingress --host app.example.com --service my-app --port 80 --tls --tls-email admin@example.com
# Done! Warren handles everything: routing, HTTPS, load balancing, auto-renewal
```

### What Makes Warren Special

- **Simple Yet Powerful**: Docker Swarm's simplicity + Kubernetes features - Kubernetes complexity
- **Single Binary**: Everything in one ~80MB binary
- **Zero Dependencies**: No etcd, no external databases, no nothing
- **Production Ready**: Multi-manager HA, secrets, volumes, health checks, mTLS, ingress
- **Edge-First**: Designed for edge computing and resource-constrained environments
- **Complete Stack**: Container runtime + orchestration + networking + ingress + observability

### Upgrade Notes

Warren v1.1 is backward compatible with v1.0. To upgrade:
1. Download new binary
2. Replace old binary
3. Restart managers (one at a time for zero downtime)
4. New ingress features available immediately

### Known Limitations

- Ingress: No WebSocket support yet (HTTP/1.1 only)
