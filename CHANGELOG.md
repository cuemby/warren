## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-15

### Removed - macOS Native Binaries (Breaking Change)

Warren v1.5.0 removes macOS binaries to eliminate confusion and clarify platform support. Warren requires Linux (containerd is Linux-only). macOS developers should use Lima VMs for development and testing.

#### Why This Change?

**The Reality**:
- Warren requires containerd, which only runs on Linux
- macOS binaries (`warren-darwin-amd64`, `warren-darwin-arm64`) couldn't actually run Warren clusters
- Shipping 50MB+ binaries that don't work created user confusion
- Developers were already using Lima VMs for testing

**The Decision**:
- **Honesty**: Be clear that Warren is a Linux container orchestrator
- **Simplicity**: Fewer builds, clearer documentation, no confusion
- **Precedent**: Many orchestrators are Linux-only (k3s, microk8s)

#### What Changed

**Build System**:
- Removed `build-darwin-amd64` and `build-darwin-arm64` targets from Makefile
- `make build-all` now only builds Linux AMD64 and ARM64
- Faster builds, simpler release process

**Documentation Updated**:
- README.md: Added "Platform Requirements" section, clarified Linux-only
- README.md: Replaced "macOS Support" with "Development on macOS" using Lima
- DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md: Notes about Linux requirement
- PRODUCTION-READY.md: Updated platform statements
- specs/prd.md: Platform compatibility clarified (pending)
- specs/tech.md: Target platforms updated (pending)

**For macOS Developers**:
```bash
# Use Lima VM for Warren development
brew install lima
limactl create --name=warren template://default
limactl start warren
limactl copy bin/warren-linux-arm64 warren:/tmp/warren
limactl shell warren sudo mv /tmp/warren /usr/local/bin/
limactl shell warren
warren cluster init  # Works in Lima!
```

#### Migration Guide

**If you were using macOS binaries** (which didn't actually work):
1. Install Lima: `brew install lima`
2. Follow the "Development on macOS" guide in README.md
3. Use Warren inside Lima VM for all operations

**If you're on Linux**:
- No changes! Warren continues to work exactly as before
- This change only affects build artifacts, not functionality

#### Benefits

- ‚úÖ Clearer product positioning (Linux container orchestrator)
- ‚úÖ Simpler build process (2 targets instead of 4)
- ‚úÖ Smaller release artifacts
- ‚úÖ No user confusion about platform support
- ‚úÖ Honest about requirements (containerd = Linux)
- ‚úÖ Aligns with Warren's simplicity philosophy

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added - Docker Swarm-Level Simplicity (Unix Socket Support)

Warren v1.4.0 achieves **true Docker Swarm simplicity** by implementing Unix socket support for zero-configuration local access. CLI commands now work immediately after cluster initialization without requiring certificate setup.

#### The Problem We Solved

**Before v1.4.0** - Tedious multi-step setup:
```bash
$ warren cluster init
$ warren node list
Error: CLI certificate not found. Please run 'warren init --manager localhost:8080 --token <token>'
# User frustration: Why do I need certificates for local commands?
```

**After v1.4.0** - Docker Swarm simplicity:
```bash
$ warren cluster init
$ warren node list
# Works immediately! üéâ
```

#### Implementation (Phase 1: Unix Socket Support)

**Core Features**:
- Unix socket server at `/var/run/warren.sock` for local access
- Automatic client detection (Unix socket ‚Üí TCP with mTLS fallback)
- Read-only security enforcement via gRPC interceptor
- Dual listener architecture (TCP + Unix socket)
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

**Files Added**:
- `pkg/api/interceptor.go` (NEW, 40 lines) - Read-only security enforcement
- `test/manual/test-unix-socket-lima.sh` (NEW, 85 lines) - E2E test script

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/api/server.go` - Added Unix socket listener support
- `cmd/warren/main.go` - Dual server startup, updated all 27 CLI commands
- `cmd/warren/apply.go` - Updated to use auto-detection
- `pkg/client/client.go` - Added `NewClientAuto()` with fallback logic
- `specs/tech.md` - Documented tiered security model

**Tiered Security Model**:
1. **Tier 1: Unix Socket** (local, instant access)
   - Path: `/var/run/warren.sock`
   - Auth: OS file permissions (0660)
   - Operations: Read-only (list, inspect, info)
   - Zero configuration required

2. **Tier 2: Auto-Bootstrap** (future - Phase 2)
   - Port: `localhost:2377`
   - Auth: Automatic cert request on first write
   - Operations: All commands

3. **Tier 3: Remote mTLS** (existing, unchanged)
   - Port: `<manager-ip>:2377`
   - Auth: Explicit `warren init` with token
   - Operations: All commands

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Unix socket created automatically at `/var/run/warren.sock`
- ‚úÖ CLI commands work immediately without `warren init`
- ‚úÖ Read-only operations accessible via Unix socket
- ‚úÖ Write operations correctly blocked with helpful error message
- ‚úÖ Dual server startup (TCP + Unix socket) working
- ‚úÖ Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

**Commands Updated** (27 total):
- Cluster: `info`
- Service: `create`, `list`, `inspect`, `delete`, `scale`, `update`, `rollback`
- Node: `list`
- Secret: `create`, `list`, `inspect`, `delete`
- Volume: `create`, `list`, `inspect`, `delete`
- Ingress: `create`, `list`, `inspect`, `delete`
- Certificate: `create`, `list`, `inspect`, `delete`
- Apply: Resource management

**Benefits**:
- **Zero-config local access**: No more `warren init` for local commands
- **Docker Swarm parity**: Matches the "just works" UX promise
- **Security maintained**: Read-only enforcement + mTLS for writes
- **Helpful errors**: Clear guidance when mTLS required
- **Production ready**: Tested in Lima VMs with real cluster

**Architecture Documentation**:
- Updated `specs/tech.md` with tiered security model
- Created `tasks/active/simplicity-refactor.md` (600+ lines) - Complete v1.4.0 roadmap

**Breaking Changes**: None

**Migration Guide**: No action required - existing workflows continue to work

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added - Advanced Deployment Strategies (Milestone 8)

Warren v1.3.0 introduces production-grade deployment strategies enabling zero-downtime deployments with multiple risk/speed tradeoffs!

#### Three Deployment Strategies

**Blue-Green Deployment**:
- Deploy full new version alongside current version
- Instant traffic switch with zero downtime
- Quick rollback capability (instant switch back)
- Service versioning with deployment labels
- Health check validation before traffic switch
- Keeps standby version for graceful rollback

**Canary Deployment**:
- Gradual traffic migration (default: 10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
- Configurable canary steps and stability windows
- Automatic rollback on health check failures
- Progressive replica scaling based on traffic weight
- Real traffic validation before full rollout
- Minimal blast radius for new versions

**Enhanced Rolling Updates**:
- Health check integration (wait for healthy before next batch)
- Automatic rollback on failures
- Max surge / max unavailable controls
- Configurable parallelism and delays
- Deployment metrics and observability

#### CLI Commands

```bash
# Rolling update (default)
warren service update web --image nginx:1.21

# Blue-green deployment
warren service update web --image nginx:1.21 --strategy blue-green

# Canary deployment with custom steps
warren service update web --image nginx:1.21 --strategy canary --canary-steps 10,50,100

# Manual rollback
warren service rollback web
```

#### API & Proto Updates

- **New RPC methods**: `UpdateServiceImage`, `RollbackService`
- **Enhanced UpdateConfig**: 9 new deployment fields (canary steps, grace periods, surge controls)
- **Deployment labels**: Version tracking, state management, strategy identification
- **ServiceManager interface**: Clean abstraction breaking import cycles

#### Deployment Metrics

New Prometheus metrics for deployment observability:
- `warren_deployments_total{strategy, status}` - Total deployments counter
- `warren_deployment_duration_seconds{strategy}` - Deployment duration histogram
- `warren_deployments_rolled_back_total{strategy, reason}` - Rollback counter

#### Architecture Improvements

- **Service versioning**: Unique version IDs for each deployment
- **Deployment states**: Active, Standby, Canary, Rolling, Failed, RolledBack
- **Service cloning**: Create versioned copies for blue-green/canary
- **Health-gated promotion**: Wait for healthy containers before proceeding
- **Automatic cleanup**: Remove old versions after grace period

#### Documentation

- **Comprehensive deployment guide** (docs/deployment-strategies.md)
- Strategy comparison and selection criteria
- Configuration examples and best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Migration guide from v1.2

### Changed

- UpdateService API now supports deployment strategy parameter
- Deployer uses ServiceManager interface instead of concrete Manager type
