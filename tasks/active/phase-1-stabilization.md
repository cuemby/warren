## Overview

Warren development follows a milestone-based approach (not MVP-based). Each milestone delivers production-ready features that build upon previous milestones. All milestones maintain the core principle: **simple, self-contained, feature-rich**.

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Binary size < 100MB
- ✅ Manager memory < 256MB
- ✅ Worker memory < 128MB
- ✅ Single binary, zero external dependencies
- ✅ Production-ready quality at each milestone
