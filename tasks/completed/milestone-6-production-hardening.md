## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

1. **Start each milestone with planning**
   - Review PRD and tech spec
   - Break down tasks into 1-3 day chunks
   - Identify dependencies and blockers

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests first (TDD)
   - Integration tests for each feature
   - Chaos tests for resilience features

3. **Commit frequently**
   - Commit after each logical unit (task completion)
   - Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
   - Reference issue numbers

4. **Documentation as you go**
   - Update README for new features
   - Add examples for new capabilities
   - Keep architecture docs current

5. **Regular reviews**
   - Code review all changes
   - Architecture review for major features
   - Performance review before milestone completion

### Quality Gates

**Before moving to next milestone**:

- [ ] All milestone tasks complete
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Binary size within budget
- [ ] Memory usage within budget
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Raft complexity → Use hashicorp/raft, extensive testing
- Binary size bloat → Continuous monitoring, build flags
- Memory leaks → Profile regularly, benchmark under load
- Edge partition reconciliation → Chaos testing, conflict resolution

**Project Risks**:
- Scope creep → Strict milestone boundaries, defer features
- Burnout → Sustainable pace, celebrate milestones
- Community adoption → Marketing, content, early user engagement

## Review & Retrospective

### Milestone 1 Review (Completed 2025-10-10)

#### What Went Well

- ✅ **Complete orchestration system working** - Manager, Worker, Scheduler, Reconciler all functional
- ✅ **Clean architecture** - Clear separation of concerns (pkg/manager/, pkg/worker/, pkg/scheduler/, etc.)
- ✅ **Full gRPC API** - 25+ methods implemented with complete protobuf definitions
- ✅ **Comprehensive CLI** - All cluster, service, and node commands working
- ✅ **Strong foundation** - BoltDB storage, Raft FSM, proper state management
- ✅ **Excellent documentation** - 100% documentation coverage (2,200+ lines for M1)
  - Quick Start Guide (450 lines)
  - API Reference (900 lines)
  - Developer Guide (800 lines)
  - Complete .agent documentation (2,500+ lines)
- ✅ **Integration testing** - End-to-end test framework created
- ✅ **Rapid development** - Milestone completed efficiently with clear planning

#### What Didn't Go Well

- ⏳ **Containerd integration deferred** - Still using simulated container execution
- ⏳ **Join tokens deferred** - Workers join without authentication (insecure for now)
- ⏳ **Some CLI commands incomplete** - `warren node inspect` deferred
- ⚠️ **No real container testing yet** - Need containerd integration for full validation

#### Action Items for Milestone 2

- [ ] Prioritize containerd integration early in M2 (critical for real-world testing)
- [ ] Implement join tokens for secure worker registration
- [ ] Add mTLS for API security
- [ ] Begin multi-manager Raft cluster work
- [ ] Set up chaos testing framework for partition tolerance

#### Key Learnings

- **Planning is critical** - Having clear PRD, tech spec, and task breakdown made development smooth
- **Documentation alongside code** - Updating docs as we go kept everything aligned
- **Simplicity first** - Deferring complex features (containerd, tokens) allowed faster M1 completion
- **Raft is simpler than expected** - hashicorp/raft library well-designed, single-node mode straightforward
- **gRPC design pays off** - Having all 25+ methods defined upfront made CLI implementation easy
- **Test framework important** - Integration test structure set up for future automated testing

#### Milestone 1 Metrics

- **Code written**: 3,900+ lines across 16 files
- **Documentation**: 4,700+ total lines (specs + docs + .agent)
- **Test coverage**: Integration test framework ready (unit tests deferred to M2)
- **Git commits**: 10+ commits with clear conventional commit messages
- **Duration**: ~3 days of focused development (ahead of 3-4 week estimate)

---

**Next Steps**: Begin Milestone 2 - High Availability
**Priority Focus**: Containerd integration, multi-manager Raft, worker autonomy
**Blockers**: None currently
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10
