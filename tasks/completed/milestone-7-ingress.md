### Milestone 7: Built-in Ingress (v1.1)

**Goal**: Add HTTP/HTTPS ingress capabilities for seamless external service access

**Priority**: [RECOMMENDED]
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-12) - All phases done, v1.1 ready üéâ

**Overview**:
Warren M7 adds a built-in ingress controller that enables HTTP/HTTPS routing to services without external load balancers. This completes Warren's networking stack and makes it production-ready for web applications.

**Success Criteria**:
- HTTP reverse proxy routes traffic to backend services
- TLS termination with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
- Path-based and host-based routing rules
- Load balancing across service replicas
- Health check integration (only route to healthy tasks)
- Zero external dependencies

#### Phase 7.1: HTTP Reverse Proxy (Week 1)

**Priority**: [CRITICAL] - Foundation for all ingress features

**Task 7.1.1: Ingress Types & Core**
- [ ] **Add Ingress types to pkg/types/types.go**
  - Ingress struct (name, rules, backend services)
  - IngressRule (host, paths, service backend)
  - IngressBackend (service name, port)
  - Test: Unit tests for ingress types

- [ ] **Implement reverse proxy (pkg/ingress/proxy.go)**
  - HTTP server listening on port 80
  - Route requests based on Host header and path
  - Proxy to backend service IPs (from DNS resolver)
  - Connection pooling and keep-alive
  - Test: Proxy single request to backend

**Task 7.1.2: Request Routing**
- [ ] **Path-based routing (pkg/ingress/router.go)**
  - Match longest prefix path (e.g., /api/v1 before /api)
  - Support exact matches and prefix matches
  - Default backend for unmatched requests
  - Test: Route /api ‚Üí service-a, /web ‚Üí service-b

- [ ] **Host-based routing**
  - Match Host header to ingress rules
  - Support wildcard hosts (*.example.com)
  - SNI-based routing (for HTTPS)
  - Test: api.example.com ‚Üí api-service, web.example.com ‚Üí web-service

**Task 7.1.3: Load Balancing**
- [ ] **Backend selection (pkg/ingress/loadbalancer.go)**
  - Query DNS resolver for service IPs
  - Round-robin selection across replicas
  - Exclude unhealthy tasks (check health status from manager)
  - Connection draining on task shutdown
  - Test: Traffic distributed evenly across 3 replicas

**Phase 7.1 Deliverables**:
- [ ] HTTP reverse proxy working
- [ ] Path and host-based routing functional
- [ ] Load balancing across service replicas
- [ ] CLI commands: `warren ingress create/list/delete`
