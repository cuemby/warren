- Long-running deployment (24+ hours)

---

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority
1. **Flaky Tests**: Scheduler race conditions (pre-existing, non-blocking)
2. **Integration Tests**: Certificate paths in CI environment
3. **Error Handling**: Some panic() calls need conversion to errors

### Medium Priority
1. **Docker Hub**: Missing credentials for automated image publishing
2. **Memory Profiling**: Need sustained load testing for memory validation
3. **Worker Autonomy**: Partition tolerance deferred to future milestone

### Low Priority
1. **Blue/Green Deployments**: Foundation exists, needs implementation
2. **Canary Deployments**: Foundation exists, needs implementation
3. **WireGuard Mesh**: POC validated, deferred for edge use cases

## Next Milestone Recommendations

### Recommendation: Complete Phase 1 First (2-3 Weeks)

**Rationale**:
1. **Quality Over Features**: Foundation is excellent, needs hardening
2. **Production Readiness**: Fix flaky tests, improve observability
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Validate stability before adding complexity
4. **User Value**: Production deployment requires operational confidence

**Phase 1 Deliverables**:
- Warren v1.2.0 (or v1.1.2) with production hardening
- Test suite with <2% flake rate
- Enhanced observability (structured logs, comprehensive metrics)
- Complete operational runbooks
- Performance validation documented

---

### After Phase 1: Milestone 8 Options

#### Option A: Blue/Green & Canary Deployments ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Why**: Highest immediate production value
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Priority**: HIGH

**Features**:
- Blue/green deployment with instant traffic switch
- Canary deployment with weighted traffic (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Enhanced rolling updates (parallelism, delay, failure actions)
- Integration with health checks for automatic rollback

**Rationale**:
- Foundation exists in M3 (deploy package created)
- Users expect this in "production-ready" orchestrator
- Differentiates Warren from simpler alternatives
- Completes core orchestration feature set
- Highest business value for enterprise adoption

**Technical Approach**:
- Leverage existing health checks and DNS resolution
- Implement service versioning with labels
- VIP switching for blue/green
- iptables probability for canary traffic splitting
- Integration tests for each strategy

---

#### Option B: Edge Resilience & Partition Tolerance
**Why**: Critical for edge computing use case (PRD priority)
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Features**:
- Worker autonomy during network partition (local state caching)
- Automatic reconciliation on reconnect
- Partition-aware scheduling (prefer local tasks)
- CRDT-based conflict resolution

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with PRD edge computing focus
- Differentiates Warren for edge/IoT deployments
- Addresses telco use case requirements
- High technical complexity (distributed systems challenge)

**Technical Approach**:
- Worker local state cache with BoltDB
- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Reconciliation engine for state merge
- Chaos testing for partition scenarios

---

#### Option C: WireGuard Mesh Networking
**Why**: Complete networking stack, improve cross-node security
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Features**:
- Automatic WireGuard mesh between all nodes
- Dynamic peer configuration (auto-join)
- Encrypted container-to-container communication
- Cross-cloud/hybrid deployments simplified

**Rationale**:
- POC already validated (M0)
- Improves security for multi-cloud deployments
- Simplifies networking in complex environments
- Current solutions (mTLS + ingress) provide security

**Technical Approach**:
- WireGuard interface per node
- Automatic peer discovery and configuration
- Subnet allocation and routing
- Integration with existing DNS

**Note**: Can be deferred since mTLS and ingress already provide security, and local networking works well.
