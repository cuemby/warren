## Phase 0: CI/CD Pipeline Fix (Post v1.1.0)

**Goal**: Restore GitHub Actions CI/CD health after v1.1.0 release
**Priority**: [BLOCKER]
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-12)
**Context**: All GitHub Actions workflows failing after M7 (Ingress) completion

### Issues Identified

1. **Certificate Test Compilation Errors** [BLOCKER]
   - `IssueNodeCertificate()` signature changed (M6 IP SAN support)
   - Missing `dnsNames []string` and `ipAddresses []net.IP` parameters
   - 6 test calls across 2 files failing to compile

2. **Go Version Mismatch** [CRITICAL]
   - `go.mod` specified Go 1.25.2 (development version, not in CI)
   - GitHub Actions uses Go 1.22 and 1.23 (stable releases)
   - golangci-lint incompatibility with toolchain version

3. **Docker Hub Publishing** [REQUIRED]
   - Missing GitHub secrets: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
   - Release workflow builds binaries but can't push Docker images

4. **Pre-existing Flaky Tests** [KNOWN ISSUE]
   - Scheduler tests: Race condition (pre-existing, deferred)
   - Integration tests: Certificate path issues in CI (pre-existing, deferred)

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **Fix certificate test signatures**
  - Updated `pkg/security/ca_test.go` (3 calls + `net` import)
  - Updated `pkg/security/certs_test.go` (3 calls + `net` import)
  - Commit: `9276d06` - "fix(ci): update certificate test signatures for IP SAN support"
  - Result: ✅ Security package tests passing (79.7% coverage)

- [x] **Fix Go version compatibility**
  - Downgraded `go.mod` from Go 1.25.2 → 1.22
  - Matches GitHub Actions workflow configuration
  - Commit: `9b287a3` - "fix(ci): downgrade go.mod to Go 1.22 for CI compatibility"
  - Result: ✅ Compilation works with CI toolchain

- [x] **Add act (GitHub Actions local testing)**
  - Installed act support for local CI/CD workflow testing
  - Created comprehensive documentation: `docs/development/local-github-actions.md`
  - Added `.actrc` configuration (medium runner image)
  - Added 10+ Makefile targets: `make act-lint`, `make act-test`, etc.
  - Commit: `8c0c6c8` - "feat(dev): add act support for local GitHub Actions testing"
  - Result: ✅ Developers can now test workflows locally before pushing

### Deliverables

- [x] Primary compilation errors fixed (security tests passing)
- [x] Go version compatibility restored (Go 1.22)
- [x] act integration for local CI/CD testing
- [x] Documentation for act usage and troubleshooting
- [x] Makefile targets for common act workflows

### Phase 0 Summary

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-12

**Commits**:
1. `9276d06` - Fix certificate test signatures (compilation errors)
2. `9b287a3` - Fix Go version mismatch (1.25.2 → 1.22)
3. `8c0c6c8` - Add act support (local GitHub Actions testing)

**Results**:
- ✅ Security package tests: PASSING (79.7% coverage)
- ✅ Compilation: WORKING on CI (Go 1.22/1.23)
- ✅ Local testing: ENABLED via act
- ⚠️ Docker Hub: Still needs credentials (non-blocking)
- ⚠️ Flaky tests: Deferred to Phase 1 (pre-existing issues)

**Key Achievements**:
- Restored core CI/CD functionality (tests compile and run)
- Added developer productivity tool (act for local testing)
- Documented troubleshooting and debugging workflow
- Fixed breaking changes from M6/M7 feature work

**Remaining Work** (Low Priority):
- Configure Docker Hub secrets for automated image publishing
- Fix scheduler race condition tests (pre-existing, non-blocking)
- Fix integration test certificate paths in CI environment

**Next Steps**: Proceed with Test Framework Migration + Phase 1 Stabilization
