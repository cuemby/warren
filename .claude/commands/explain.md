## Context-Driven Code Explanation

Before explaining any code:

1. **Read `.agent/README.md`** to understand the current system state
2. **Check `.agent/System/`** for architecture context and how this code fits in
3. **Review `.agent/SOP/`** for project patterns and conventions
4. **Reference `.agent/Tasks/`** for feature context if this code is part of a specific feature

## Explanation Process

Provide detailed explanation of [piece of code] following this systematic workflow:

### 1. Context Discovery Phase

- Identify where this code lives in the project structure
- Understand its role within the system architecture (reference `.agent/System/`)
- Determine its purpose: feature implementation, utility, integration, etc.
- Check if it's documented in `.agent/Tasks/` or `.agent/SOP/`

### 2. High-Level Overview

- **Purpose**: What problem does this code solve?
- **Input/Output**: What does it take in and what does it produce?
- **Scope**: Is it a function, class, module, or system component?
- **Dependencies**: What does it rely on? (check `.agent/System/` for integration points)

### 3. Detailed Walkthrough

- Break down the code line-by-line or block-by-block
- Explain logic flow and control structures
- Describe algorithms and data transformations
- Highlight key operations and their significance
- Explain error handling and edge case management

### 4. Technical Analysis

- **Architecture Pattern**: What design pattern is used? (reference `.agent/SOP/`)
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the code
- **State Management**: How state is handled (if applicable)
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Time/space complexity where relevant
- **Technology Stack**: Libraries, frameworks, or APIs used (reference `.agent/System/`)

### 5. Best Practices & Patterns

- Identify best practices demonstrated in the code
- Reference similar patterns in `.agent/SOP/`
- Highlight good coding techniques
- Note adherence to project standards from `.agent/System/`
- Explain why certain approaches were chosen

### 6. Use Cases & Applications

- Primary use case: When and why is this code used?
- Alternative use cases or applications
- Integration points with other system components
- Real-world scenarios where this code executes

### 7. Improvements & Optimizations

- Potential performance optimizations
- Readability improvements
- Maintainability enhancements
- Scalability considerations
- Suggest if this pattern should be documented in `.agent/SOP/`

### 8. Documentation Recommendations

- Should this be documented in `.agent/System/` as a key component?
- Is this pattern worth adding to `.agent/SOP/`?
- Are there missing inline comments that would help?
