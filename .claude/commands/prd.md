## Context-Driven Product Requirements Document Creation

Before creating a PRD:

1. **Read `.agent/README.md`** to understand project context and standards
2. **Check `.agent/System/`** for current system state and architecture
3. **Review `.agent/SOP/`** for documentation best practices
4. **Reference `.agent/Tasks/prd-template.md`** for the complete template structure

## PRD Creation Process

Generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document following the vibe-coding philosophy (context-driven, not time-driven) using this systematic workflow:

### 1. Context Discovery Phase

**Read Project Context**:
- Review `.agent/README.md` for project overview
- Check `.agent/System/principles.md` for core principles
- Review `.agent/System/priority-levels.md` for priority framework
- Scan existing PRDs in `docs/prd/` for patterns

**Gather Essential Information from User**:

**Feature/Product Basics**:
- Feature/Product Name
- Brief one-line description
- Is this: [New Feature | Enhancement | Refactor | Bug Fix | Other]
- Related to existing feature? [If yes, which one]

**Problem Understanding**:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who experiences this problem?
- How painful is it? [Low | Medium | High | Critical]
- What happens if we don't solve it?
- How is it currently handled (workarounds)?

**User Context**:
- Primary user type/persona
- Secondary user types (if any)
- Technical proficiency: [Low | Medium | High]
- Current behavior/workflow

**Scope & Priority**:
- Priority Level: [BLOCKER] | [CRITICAL] | [REQUIRED] | [RECOMMENDED] | [OPTIONAL]
- Context Complexity: XS | S | M | L | XL
  - XS: Trivial, single concept
  - S: Simple, few related concepts
  - M: Moderate, multiple interconnected concepts
  - L: Large, complex system with dependencies
  - XL: Extra large (needs breakdown)

---

### 2. Requirements Gathering Phase

**Must-Have Requirements** (MVP):
- Ask: "What are the absolute must-haves for this to work?"
- For each requirement:
  - Requirement description
  - Why is this essential?
  - Context complexity: [XS/S/M/L]
  - Dependencies

**Should-Have Requirements**:
- Ask: "What's important but not critical?"
- Capture with context complexity

**Could-Have Requirements**:
- Ask: "What would be nice to have?"
- Capture for future iterations

**Won't-Have (This Iteration)**:
- Ask: "What's explicitly out of scope?"
- Document to prevent scope creep

---

### 3. User Story Development

**For Each Epic/Story**:

Create user stories in this format:
```markdown
### Epic: [Epic Name]

#### Story: [Story Title]

**As a** [user type]
**I want** [capability]
**So that** [benefit/value]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **GIVEN** [context], **WHEN** [action], **THEN** [outcome]
- [ ] **GIVEN** [context], **WHEN** [action], **THEN** [outcome]
- [ ] **GIVEN** [context], **WHEN** [action], **THEN** [outcome]

**Priority**: P0 (Critical) | P1 (High) | P2 (Medium) | P3 (Low)
**Context Complexity**: XS | S | M | L | XL
**Dependencies**: [List]
```

**Ask user**:
- What are the main user workflows?
- What does success look like for the user?
- What edge cases should we handle?

---

### 4. Success Metrics Definition

**Ask user to define measurable success**:
- What metrics will we track?
- What's the current baseline (if known)?
- What's the target?
- How will we measure?

**Example metrics**:
- User engagement (usage frequency, time spent)
- Performance (response time, load time)
- Business (conversion rate, revenue impact)
- Quality (error rate, user satisfaction)

---

### 5. Context Complexity Assessment

**Overall Assessment**:
- Ask: "How much understanding is needed to build this?"
- Break down by area:
  - User Experience: [XS/S/M/L/XL]
  - Technical Implementation: [XS/S/M/L/XL]
  - Integration: [XS/S/M/L/XL]
  - Data Model: [XS/S/M/L/XL]
  - Testing: [XS/S/M/L/XL]

**Context Dependencies**:
- What existing systems need to be understood?
- What new concepts need to be learned?
- What external knowledge is required?

---

### 6. Iteration Phase Planning

**Instead of timeline milestones, define readiness phases**:

**Phase 0: Foundation**
- Readiness Criteria:
  - [ ] Core architecture decided
  - [ ] Key concepts understood
  - [ ] Dependencies identified
  - [ ] Team has necessary context
- Deliverables: ADRs, technical spikes, POCs

**Phase 1: Bootstrap**
- Readiness Criteria:
  - [ ] Basic functionality working
  - [ ] Core workflows implemented
  - [ ] Integration points proven
  - [ ] Happy path testable
- Deliverables: Working prototype, core features

**Phase 2: Enhancement**
- Readiness Criteria:
  - [ ] All Must-Have features complete
  - [ ] Edge cases handled
  - [ ] Performance acceptable
  - [ ] Should-Have features integrated
- Deliverables: Feature-complete state

**Phase 3: Refinement**
- Readiness Criteria:
  - [ ] Could-Have features evaluated
  - [ ] Polished UX
  - [ ] Production-ready
  - [ ] Team confident in deployment
- Deliverables: Production release

---

### 7. Risk Assessment

**Ask user about risks**:
- What could go wrong?
- What are we uncertain about?
- What external dependencies worry you?
- What's the learning curve?

**Document risks with**:
- Risk description
- Probability: [Low | Medium | High]
- Impact: [Low | Medium | High]
- Context Complexity involved
- Mitigation strategy

---

### 8. Vibe Check

**Ask user for gut feeling validation**:
- Does this feel right?
- Is the problem clearly defined?
- Does the solution make intuitive sense?
- Is the scope manageable?
- Does the team have necessary context?
- Are you excited to build this?

**Red flags to check**:
- Too much complexity for the value?
- Scope creeping during planning?
- Unclear user value?
- Team lacks critical context?

**Confidence Level**: üò∞ Low | üòê Medium | üòä High | üöÄ Very High

---

### 9. Document Generation

**Generate PRD using `.agent/Tasks/prd-template.md` structure**:

1. Fill in all sections from gathered information
2. Use context complexity instead of time estimates
3. Use iteration phases instead of timeline milestones
4. Include vibe check section
5. Cross-reference `.agent/` documentation
6. Add all user stories with acceptance criteria
7. Include risk assessment
8. Document open questions

**File naming**: `docs/prd/[feature-name].md`
- Use kebab-case
- Make it descriptive
- Example: `user-authentication.md`, `payment-integration.md`

---

### 10. Review & Validation

**Present PRD to user for review**:
- Show generated PRD
- Highlight key sections
- Ask for feedback on:
  - Completeness
  - Accuracy
  - Clarity
  - Missing information
  - Scope correctness

**Iterate if needed**:
- Make adjustments based on feedback
- Add missing details
- Clarify ambiguities
- Adjust priorities or complexity

---

### 11. Cross-Referencing

**Update related documentation**:
- Add entry to `docs/README.md` (if exists)
- Reference in `.agent/Tasks/` if task-specific
- Note in `.agent/System/` if architecture impact
- Link to related PRDs or tech specs

**Create tracking**:
- Suggest creating tech spec: "Run `/tech-spec` to create technical specification"
- Suggest creating user stories: "Run `/user-stories` to extract detailed user stories"

## Interactive Prompts

Use these prompts to gather information:

### Initial Prompt
```
I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD using our vibe-coding adapted template.

Let's start with the basics:

1. What's the name of this feature/product?
2. In one sentence, what does it do?
3. What priority level is this?
   [BLOCKER] | [CRITICAL] | [REQUIRED] | [RECOMMENDED] | [OPTIONAL]
```

### Problem Discovery Prompt
```
Let's understand the problem:

1. What problem are we solving?
2. Who experiences this problem most?
3. How painful is it? [Low | Medium | High | Critical]
4. What happens if we don't solve it?
5. How do users currently work around this?
```

### Requirements Prompt
```
Let's define the requirements:

MUST HAVE (MVP):
What are the absolute essentials? List them one by one.
[For each: Why is this essential? Context complexity?]

SHOULD HAVE:
What's important but not critical?

COULD HAVE:
What would be nice to have later?

WON'T HAVE:
What's explicitly out of scope?
```

### User Stories Prompt
```
Let's create user stories:

For the main workflow:
- As a [who], I want [what], so that [why]
- What are the acceptance criteria? (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format)
- Priority? [P0/P1/P2/P3]
- Context complexity? [XS/S/M/L/XL]

Any other workflows or edge cases?
```

### Success Metrics Prompt
```
How will we measure success?

1. What metric(s) will we track?
2. What's the current state (baseline)?
3. What's the target?
4. How will we measure it?
```

### Context Complexity Prompt
```
Let's assess context complexity:

How much understanding is needed for:
- User Experience: [XS | S | M | L | XL]
- Technical Implementation: [XS | S | M | L | XL]
- Integration: [XS | S | M | L | XL]
- Data Model: [XS | S | M | L | XL]
- Testing: [XS | S | M | L | XL]

What existing systems need to be understood?
What new concepts need to be learned?
```

### Risk Assessment Prompt
```
What could go wrong?

For each risk:
- What's the risk?
- Probability: [Low | Medium | High]
- Impact: [Low | Medium | High]
- How do we mitigate it?
```

### Vibe Check Prompt
```
Final vibe check:

‚úì Does this feel right?
‚úì Is the problem clearly defined?
‚úì Does the solution make sense?
‚úì Is the scope manageable?
‚úì Do we have the necessary context?
‚úì Are you excited about this?

Any red flags?
- Too complex for the value?
- Scope creeping?
- Unclear value?
- Missing critical context?

Confidence level: üò∞ Low | üòê Medium | üòä High | üöÄ Very High
```
