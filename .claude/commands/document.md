## Context-Driven Code Documentation

Before documenting any code:

1. **Read `.agent/README.md`** to understand documentation standards and structure
2. **Check `.agent/System/`** for system architecture and how this code fits in
3. **Review `.agent/SOP/`** for documentation best practices and templates
4. **Reference `.agent/Tasks/`** for feature context and acceptance criteria

## Documentation Process

Write comprehensive documentation for [code] following this systematic workflow:

### 1. Context Discovery Phase

- Understand the code's role in the system (reference `.agent/System/`)
- Identify target audience: new developers, experienced devs, or both
- Determine documentation scope: inline comments, API docs, or comprehensive guide
- Check if related documentation exists in `.agent/`

### 2. Content Planning Phase

- Define documentation structure and sections
- Identify key components to document
- Plan examples and use cases
- Determine what goes in code vs. `.agent/` docs

### 3. Overview Documentation

- **Purpose**: What problem does this code solve?
- **Scope**: What's included and what's not
- **Context**: How it fits in the larger system (reference `.agent/System/`)
- **Audience**: Who should use this code
- **Prerequisites**: What knowledge or setup is required

### 4. Component Documentation

- Break down each major component
- Explain logic and functionality
- Document parameters, return values, and side effects
- Include complexity and performance characteristics
- Reference related patterns from `.agent/SOP/`

### 5. Usage Documentation

- Provide practical examples
- Show common use cases
- Include code snippets with explanations
- Document integration points
- Reference system architecture from `.agent/System/`

### 6. Reference Documentation

- API reference (functions, classes, methods)
- Configuration options
- Environment variables
- Dependencies and version requirements
- Error codes and messages

### 7. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Highlight best practices from `.agent/SOP/`
- Document common mistakes to avoid
- Include troubleshooting guide
- Add performance tips
- Security considerations

### 8. Maintenance Documentation

- Where to update `.agent/` docs when code changes
- How this relates to `.agent/System/` architecture
- Patterns to follow from `.agent/SOP/`
- Testing and validation approach
